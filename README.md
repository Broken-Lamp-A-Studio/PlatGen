## Game info

### About story of game
 Many, many, but for seriously not many months ago I think about some game with things like open world, modding, survival, story and open source. 
 Finally I started making game called PlatGen and here is actual stage. The basic game version was not good. 
 It has many errors and bugs. So I decided to remake it. 
 Still it's unfinished but at some point i will release new updates.
 Wish me luck or something... - **GamePlayer**

### Updates
 Today PlatGen is still in early access. I'm still adding new elements and features to it. 
 But when I'm adding something new, then game is going bigger and bigger, sometimes fixing some problems is hard. 
 I'm sorry if bug fixes will be release very soon.
 But thank you for keeping up following this project and helping with making some new features. :)

## Future
Here's the future plans of the PlatGen game.

### Ideas
**Main plot**:
 Imagine an Earth a few years later engulfed by wars to such an extent that the only way to survive is to go underground...
 The story is starting when one of the underground structures get damaged and main character/characters was in.
 This structure accidentally fall into the mystery cave/area. Other part of structure (which did not collapse) was crushed by rocks. 
 Main character will want to back to good/old times before wars. 

**Basic**:
 - Digging;
 - Inventory;
 - Crafting;
 - Story Mode.

**Gameplay**:
 - Exploring unknown underground world;
 - Researching technologies;
 - Crafting/automating stuff;
 - Founding other (small) civilations;
 - and more...

#### About bosses/monsters
I'm not sure, what exactly i will add but here's the list of example creatures:
 - bat;
 - spider (not look like from minecraft, a real spider);
 - pets (maybe dogs but i'm not sure);
 - ???
Agressive:
 - AbyssMaker (a giant creature, who's terrorizes the Abysses);
 - Alien Strucutres;
 - some civilizations;
 - ???
