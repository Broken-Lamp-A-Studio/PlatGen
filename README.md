# PlatGen

## About story of game
 Many, many, but for seriously not many months ago somebody think about some game with open world, modding, survival, story and open source. This game is something what somebody want (idk, who exactly xD) and here's it. This game is on github, place where you can publish stuff for free, this game is calling PlatGen. First elements in this game is of course Platformer elements and Generating world. First PlatGen was not good. It has many errors ang bugs. So some months ago the game is changed. All stuff about Platformer is gone. Generating terrain is now better than before. But still doesn't have something what will make this game one of good from open source games. Game mustn't be famous to be cool. Even to this game no one need 25 or 50 people or more to make it. Better this game can make one guy. And it's already going on. The guy who making this have so much work to make it, but he's can. This guy is me - GamePlayer. I don't think bad things about this game. I don't want ads or bad content in it. Yes, I know, actually this game is so small. And somebody can say "This game is sh*t.", but I will not give up. I will keep up my work. Because I don't care, if somebody thinks bad about this game, my own game. Maybe that's why this game is still here, maybe not. I want to take care of my game, as I can. Because this game is for everyone. Not for only me or for company. And if I'm doing this game bad, who cares? I did a lot of things about this game and I want more. Because I'm happy with making it. Because I'm GamePlayer, the guy who do something wrong playing and making games (I should play, not make, lol). So yeah, welcome in this repo (this is the weirdest introduction what I maked, seriously)...

## Updates
 Today PlatGen is still in early access. I'm still adding new elements and features to it. But when I'm adding something new, then game is going bigger and bigger, sometimes fixing some problems is hard. Then I'm sorry if bug fixes will be release very soon. But thank you for keep up following this project and helping in scripting it. You can always make an issue. On wiki you have informations, how to do it, but this is only suggestion. Have fun with helping! :)

## Story in game
 The guy what you can see is from next civilization from Earth. Before he's lives in a laboratory in underground. At Someday something hit the surface of the planet. The impact damaged the laboratory and the detachment of its parts together with the protagonist right into the caves.
